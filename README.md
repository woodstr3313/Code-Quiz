# Code-Quiz
This application was created to test users on basic computer science questions. This application also scores the user on how they answer the displayed questions.  I updated the Javascript file to allow this application to function the appropriate way. I used jquery to also make some updates to my html file. I first added comments to my javascript file and then started out by running a console.log to see what was happening on the page. I then created a bank to hold each of my questions and answers in. I then created a highscore prompt at the end of the quiz so the user can compare their score to others.. I finished by adding some css using bootstrap.
